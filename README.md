# SeeMoreSeeLess HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
A small See More See Less project.<br>
The project has three sections, each with a + button. By clicking on it, you can see more or less information.<br>
The project is responsive, ideal for understanding how this option works.<br>
It includes social media links in the footer, which is fixed.<br>

# Thank you. :octocat:
